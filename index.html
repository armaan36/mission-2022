            <p>A personal mission statement defines who you are as a person (or as a team member where you work) and
                identifies your purpose, whether that's in the office or simply in life. It explains how you aim to
                pursue that purpose, and why it matters so much to you.

                <h2 class="orange-color">vision</h2>
                <p>Before any website can be effective or even attractive in our world of drive-by users, it has to have
                    a purpose — a clear, explainable, concise purpose that people can spot immediately. ... They all
                    come from a vision statement — a document that lays out the core scope and purpose of the site.

                <h2 class="orange-color">Goals</h2>
                <p>A major motivation for a web designer is self-expression in being able to design and develop a
                    website to be proud of. Another goal is to make sure users of the website have a good experience.
                    Finally, a web designer hopes for career rewards, such as good pay and advancement.</p>

            <h1><span class="red-color">Develop-skills</span></h1>
            <p>So a Web Developer should have several skills that encompass both computers and people, including:
                Programming skills in front-end languages like JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5. Back-end languages, like
                JQuery, third-party APIs, web services, and e-commerce, will all be important.

            <h1><span class="red-color">My Mission</span></h1>
            <p>Everyone of us has a mission to deal with for a purpose or mission that only God knows of it.

                My mission in my life is to finished my studies and fulfill my dreams in order to have a good and stable
                job. So that I can help my parents to their financial need but not only to them but also those needy
                people and also those street children.
                My another mission in my life is to do goods and spread the words of God to the part where there is no
                teaching of God's word.


                These all mission that I have can be done according to God's will and through my hardships and
                sacrifices.
